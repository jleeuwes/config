Configuration and setup for our Raspberry Pi Home Assistant
=====

We use hassbian (so we can put some things on the pi besides home assistant).
Based on setup instructions at https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/hassbian/installation/

This directory contains the normal komputiloj top-level directories to symlink
on the machine,
plus this readme,
plus a _setup directory with scripts to easily restore a working configuration
in case of a new or corrupted SD card.
