# Okay, so, about the state.
# We need to keep the state because it seems to be the only way
# to have the correct NixOS stateVersion, namely the NixOS version
# of the first deploy of the server.
# The rest of the state is not very important (for instance,
# we provision our own SSH keys so we don't need the state for that).
#
# Since I am the only one working on this deployment,
# we can get away with a simple scheme otherwise full of race conditions:
# 1. Try to get the latest state from gently,
#    but don't really mind if this fails, which can easily happen
#    if some services on gently, such as storage, are currently down.
# 2. Do the deploy.
# 3. Copy the state back to gently.
